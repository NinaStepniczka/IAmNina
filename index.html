<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Nina</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a junior studying Media and Professional Communications. I also have a Studio Arts minor and German Studies minor. While the mix of communications, art, and German is not traditional, they are all interests I knew I wanted to persue while I had the more diciplined structure of being in college and being in a classroom.</h3>
  </div>



<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->


  <img src="horizon1.jpg" alt="a sunset over some mountains and trees" class="center-img" style="width:70%;"></img>


<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>For the past two and a half years I have taken countless writing classes. I have also taken a variety of art classes including Visual Thinking, Drawing Studio 1, Photography 1, and am now enrolled in Digital Imaging and Painting Studio 1. The interaction between digital and physical mediums interests me a lot so I signed up for this class in hopes of learning how to intertwine my passions for art, writing, and digital media. Plus, I want to walk away from this course with the skills to put together a portfolio website for my personal art too.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>Design is a foreign subject to me, but based on what little I do know (and with some help from the internet), I have compiled a few important elements. First, if the design is for a client, ensuring the design is communicative should be a high priority. It should get a clear message across without being too cluttered or too sparse. Therefore, it needs to be detailed and straightforward while also being visually pleasing. An element I would hope designers also value is originality. While some projects are likely more professional or plain, keeping designs unique help to make people want to look at it longer or thinking about it once they've looked away.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>My future is somewhat of a mystery to me. I have always said I would love to end up involved in the music industry in some way, whether that be copywriting newsletters or creating tour promotion, but I would also be content in any job where I get to maintain some level of creativity. My family members are all in STEM fields and my dad has always encouraged me to learn to code, so I am working towards figuring out if there is a realistic job for me that can combine all my interests and skills. Thankfully, this class should help me out a lot with this!</h3>
